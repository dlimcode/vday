                Everyone, anyone who want to hear<br>
                Move in a little closer, let me tell you about<br>
                A love natural, oh that love actual<br>
                Love that you just can't help feeling<br>
                When feelings with meanings keep on appearing<br>
                <br>
                And it's almost midnight, the time is coming up<br>
                The time is getting closer, the time is almost here<br>
                Life is upon us and the time for love is here and now<br>
